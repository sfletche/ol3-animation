## Experimenting with OpenLayers 3 animation...

Note:  This project requires [OpenLayers 3](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases) to be installed at the same base directory.  

### Next Steps
* add potential for multiple markers (with differentiated content) at a given map view
* dynamically position marker popup according to position
* how to display marker popups...?
 * display marker popups after fly to?  
 * one at a time?
* do a little refactoring...encapsulate methods and variables better...
