## Experimenting with OpenLayers 3 animation...

Note:  This project requires [OpenLayers 3](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases) to be installed at the same base directory.  

### Next Steps
* Display location related content synced with zoom animation
* Provide additional content
* add forward/backward arrows/indicators to map so users can advance at their own pace
  * this will also provide the space for multiple markers at a given map view
* enable marker add functionality 
  * users can add/position multiple markers at each map location
  * 

### Complete
* Bounce resolution based on distance between locations (higher bounce resolution for larger distances)
* Start Date and End Date
