## Experimenting with OpenLayers 3 animation...

Note:  This project requires [OpenLayers 3](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases) to be installed at the same base directory.  

### Next Steps
* add potential for multiple markers (with differentiated content) at a given map view
* build map view / indicator into url
* how to display marker popups...?
 * I think best UI is to show popups for all markers on the map view
    * activate popups for all markers after zoom in
    * de-activate popups when zooming out
* adjust duration of animation based on distance travelled
* experimenting with rotating map view going to/from New Zealand 
 * still needs some tweaking, might experiment with 180 degree rotation too
* do a little refactoring...encapsulate methods and variables better...
