## Experimenting with OpenLayers 3 animation...

Note:  This project requires [OpenLayers 3](https://github.com/openlayers/ol3/releases) to be installed at the same base directory.  

### Next Steps
* Display location related content synced with zoom animation
* Provide additional content
  * Start Date and End Date
* Timeline style animation (but with Year counter rather than timeline)
* Animation speed based on time spend at a given location
* Bounce resolution based on distance between locations (higher bounce resolution for larger distances)
